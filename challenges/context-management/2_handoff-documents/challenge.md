# Challenge 2: Handoff Documents

**Category:** Context Management
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Related Tip:** #8

## Description

Session continuity is critical for long-running projects. This challenge teaches you to write effective handoff documents that enable seamless transitions between conversations, preserving context and momentum.

## Objective

Master the art of creating handoff documents that contain just the right amount of information to resume work efficiently without information loss.

## Background

Claude conversations don't persist indefinitely. When starting a new session, you need to reconstruct relevant context. Well-crafted handoff documents are the bridge between sessions, enabling continuity without bloat.

## Steps to Complete

1. **Understand Handoff Document Components**
   - Current state summary
   - Decisions and rationale
   - Active work context
   - Next steps

2. **Practice Information Prioritization**
   - Distinguish essential vs nice-to-have
   - Compress verbose explanations
   - Maintain technical accuracy

3. **Create a Reusable Template**
   - Design for your workflow
   - Include all critical sections
   - Keep it scannable

4. **Test Session Continuity**
   - Use handoff to start new conversation
   - Verify no context loss
   - Measure time to resume productivity

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Create a handoff document template that fits your workflow
- [ ] Write a handoff document <2000 tokens that captures complex work
- [ ] Successfully resume work in new session without repeating explanations
- [ ] Document includes decisions, not just facts

## Example Scenario

You've spent a session:
- Debugging a performance issue in a React app
- Identified 3 potential causes
- Fixed 2 of them
- Need to continue investigating the 3rd

Create a handoff document that lets you resume efficiently tomorrow.

## Challenges to Consider

- How much code context to include?
- Should you include failed approaches?
- How to capture "why" not just "what"?
- How to structure for quick scanning?

## Resources

- Handoff docs should be forward-looking
- Include just enough past context
- Focus on actionable information
