# Progressive Automation - Medium

**Related Tip:** #41 - Automate recurring tasks progressively

## Description

Learn to identify, prioritize, and progressively automate recurring tasks. This challenge teaches how to build automation incrementally, starting with simple scripts and evolving to sophisticated workflows, using Claude Code as your automation assistant.

## Objective

Master progressive automation by:
1. Identifying high-value automation opportunities
2. Starting with simple scripts (5-10 minutes to build)
3. Iteratively improving automation based on usage
4. Balancing automation effort vs time saved
5. Using Claude Code to generate automation scripts

## Background

**The Automation Paradox:**
- Spending 4 hours to automate a 5-minute task
- "I'll automate this later" (never happens)
- Over-engineering simple automations

**Progressive Approach:**
- V1: Simple script (10 min to create, saves 5 min/day)
- V2: Add error handling (20 min, saves frustration)
- V3: Add configuration (15 min, makes it reusable)
- V4: Add logging & notifications (30 min, improves reliability)

**Total effort: 75 minutes**
**ROI: Saves 25+ hours/year if task runs daily**

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Task Analysis
Identify 5 recurring tasks you do weekly:
- Track time spent on each
- Calculate potential time savings
- Prioritize by effort vs impact

### 2. Build V1 Automation
Choose highest-impact task and automate it:
- Use Claude Code to generate script
- Keep it simple (< 50 lines)
- Test basic functionality
- Time: 10-15 minutes maximum

### 3. Iterate Based on Usage
After using V1 for a week:
- Identify pain points
- Add improvements incrementally
- Track actual time savings

### 4. Create Automation Library
Build reusable automation scripts:
- Database backup script
- Log rotation script
- Dependency updater
- Code formatter runner
- Test reporter

### 5. Share and Standardize
- Document your automations
- Share with team
- Create team automation library
- Establish conventions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Identified 5+ recurring tasks worth automating
- [ ] Built V1 automation in under 15 minutes
- [ ] Used automation for 1 week, tracked time saved
- [ ] Improved automation based on real usage
- [ ] Created at least 3 reusable automation scripts
- [ ] ROI positive (time saved > time invested)
- [ ] Documented automations for team use
- [ ] Can articulate when NOT to automate

## Real-World Application

**Common Automation Targets:**
- Daily database backups
- Log cleanup and rotation
- Dependency updates (npm, pip, cargo)
- Code formatting on commit
- Test suite execution
- Build and deployment
- Environment setup
- Data synchronization
- Report generation
- API testing

## Time Estimate

60-90 minutes (spread over multiple sessions)

## Prerequisites

- Basic scripting knowledge (bash, Python, or PowerShell)
- Access to Claude Code
- Recurring tasks to automate
- Ability to run scripts on your system
