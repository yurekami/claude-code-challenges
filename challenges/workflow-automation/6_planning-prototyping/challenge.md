# Balance Planning with Prototyping - Medium

**Related Tip:** #39 - Balance planning with quick prototyping

## Description

Learn to strike the optimal balance between upfront planning and quick prototyping. This challenge teaches when to plan extensively, when to prototype immediately, and how to use Claude Code effectively for both approaches.

## Objective

Master the art of:
1. Identifying when to plan vs when to prototype
2. Using rapid prototyping to validate assumptions
3. Leveraging Claude Code for quick experiments
4. Knowing when detailed planning saves time
5. Combining both approaches for complex features

## Background

**Over-Planning:**
- 2 hours planning perfect architecture
- Requirements change before implementation
- Analysis paralysis

**Under-Planning:**
- Jump straight to coding
- Hit unforeseen blockers
- Need to refactor/rewrite

**Balanced Approach:**
- Quick prototype to validate core concept (30 min)
- Plan based on learnings from prototype (30 min)
- Implement with confidence (2 hours)

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Decision Framework
Create a decision matrix for when to:
- Plan first, then implement
- Prototype first, then plan
- Do both in parallel
- Skip planning and ship

### 2. Quick Prototype Exercise
Build a throwaway prototype in 15 minutes:
- Use Claude Code to generate boilerplate
- Test core assumption
- Discard code, keep learnings

### 3. Planning Exercise
For the same feature, create a detailed plan:
- Architecture design
- Data flow diagrams
- API contracts
- Test strategy

### 4. Comparison Analysis
Compare the two approaches:
- Time spent
- Quality of final solution
- Confidence in approach
- Blockers discovered

### 5. Hybrid Approach
Combine both methods:
- Prototype risky/unknown parts
- Plan well-understood components
- Iterate between both

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Created decision framework for planning vs prototyping
- [ ] Built working prototype in under 20 minutes
- [ ] Created detailed plan for same feature
- [ ] Identified which approach saved more time
- [ ] Successfully used Claude Code for rapid prototyping
- [ ] Can articulate when to use each approach
- [ ] Demonstrated hybrid approach on complex feature

## Real-World Application

**Prototype First:**
- New technology/framework evaluation
- Proof of concept for client
- Validating technical feasibility
- Exploring API capabilities
- Performance testing approaches

**Plan First:**
- Database schema migrations
- Authentication/authorization systems
- Complex state management
- Multi-service integration
- Refactoring critical paths

**Hybrid:**
- New features with unknown requirements
- Third-party API integration
- Performance optimization
- Architecture redesign

## Time Estimate

40-50 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Access to Claude Code
- Sample project or feature idea
- Basic understanding of software design
- Ability to write code quickly
