# Background Execution Challenge

**Related Tip:** Tip 36 - Use Ctrl+B for background tasks and spawn subagents

## Description

Some tasks take time. Claude Code allows background execution and subagent spawning for parallel work. This challenge explores concurrent task management.

## Objective

Master background task execution and subagent coordination for parallel workflows and long-running operations.

## Challenge Tasks

1. **Background Long-Running Tasks** - Run tests, builds, or analysis in background
2. **Parallel Subagents** - Spawn multiple agents for independent work
3. **Task Coordination** - Manage dependencies between parallel tasks
4. **Resource Management** - Balance concurrent operations

## Success Criteria

- Execute long-running tasks in background
- Coordinate multiple parallel workflows
- Manage task dependencies effectively
- Optimize overall completion time

## Key Skills to Practice

- Concurrent thinking
- Task decomposition
- Dependency management
- Resource allocation
- Progress monitoring
