# Iterative Problem Solving Solution

## Iteration Process

### Cycle 1: Naive Attempt
```
"I've never used WebAssembly. Help me compile a simple C program to WASM and run it in the browser."
```
**Result:** Basic understanding, possible errors
**Learning:** Core concepts, toolchain basics

### Cycle 2: Address Issues
```
"I got this error: [error]. What's wrong and how do I fix it?"
```
**Result:** Working basic example
**Learning:** Common pitfalls, debugging

### Cycle 3: Add Features
```
"Now add interop between JavaScript and WASM. I want to call WASM functions from JS."
```
**Result:** More complete solution
**Learning:** Advanced patterns

### Cycle 4: Optimize
```
"How can I make this faster? What WASM optimizations are available?"
```
**Result:** Production-ready code
**Learning:** Best practices

## Unknown Domain Examples

### Example 1: Machine Learning (No ML Experience)
```
Iteration 1: "Explain ML basics and help me set up TensorFlow.js"
Iteration 2: "Build a simple image classifier with pre-trained model"
Iteration 3: "Train a custom model on my dataset"
Iteration 4: "Optimize for production use"
```

### Example 2: Game Development (No Game Dev Experience)
```
Iteration 1: "Help me understand game loops and set up a canvas"
Iteration 2: "Add player movement and collision detection"
Iteration 3: "Implement enemy AI"
Iteration 4: "Add particle effects and polish"
```

## Embracing Failure

**Failed Attempt:**
```
"Build a blockchain from scratch"
[Too ambitious, gets stuck]
```

**Learn and Adjust:**
```
"That was too complex. Let's start simpler:
1. Understand hashing
2. Build a single block
3. Chain blocks together
4. Add proof of work
One step at a time."
```

## Success Indicators

- Complete projects in 3+ unfamiliar domains
- Recover from failures quickly
- Build confidence in learning
- Reduce time to productivity in new areas
