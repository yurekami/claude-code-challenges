# Personalized Software Solution

## Tool Building Process

### Step 1: Identify Need
```
"I waste time every day manually organizing screenshots. I need a tool that:
- Watches a folder for new screenshots
- Uses OCR to extract text
- Organizes by content type (code, design, text, etc.)
- Renames files meaningfully"
```

### Step 2: Rapid Prototype
```
"Create a quick Node.js script that does this basic functionality. Don't worry about edge cases yet, just get something working."
```

### Step 3: Test and Refine
```
"I used it for a week. Issues found:
- Doesn't handle images without text
- File naming collisions
- Too slow for many files
Help me fix these."
```

### Step 4: Polish
```
"Add:
- Progress bar
- Configuration file
- Error logging
- Installation instructions"
```
