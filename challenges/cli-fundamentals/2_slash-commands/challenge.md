# Slash Commands Mastery

**Related Tip:** Tip 1: Master /usage, /chrome, /mcp, /stats, /clear

## Description

Slash commands are Claude Code's power user shortcuts. They provide quick access to session management, browser integration, MCP server connections, statistics, and context clearing - all without leaving your conversation flow.

## Objective

Master the essential slash commands to efficiently manage your Claude Code sessions, monitor usage, integrate external tools, and maintain optimal context.

## Essential Slash Commands

### Core Commands
- `/usage` - Display current token usage and cost estimates
- `/chrome` - Integrate Chrome browser for web scraping and screenshots
- `/mcp` - Connect to Model Context Protocol servers
- `/stats` - Show detailed session statistics
- `/clear` - Clear conversation history (maintain context)

### Additional Commands
- `/help` - List all available commands
- `/model` - Switch AI models
- `/files` - Show files in current context
- `/reset` - Hard reset (clear everything)

## Steps to Complete

1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Execute `/usage` to check your token consumption
3. Run `/stats` to see detailed session metrics
4. Test `/chrome` command (if Chrome is available)
5. Explore `/mcp` to see available MCP servers
6. Use `/clear` to clean up context while preserving important state
7. Try `/help` to discover additional commands

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can check token usage and costs with `/usage`
- [ ] Can monitor session statistics with `/stats`
- [ ] Understand when to use `/clear` vs `/reset`
- [ ] Can integrate Chrome browser with `/chrome`
- [ ] Know how to connect MCP servers with `/mcp`
- [ ] Can list all available files with `/files`
- [ ] Can switch models with `/model`

## Why This Matters

Slash commands enable:
- **Cost monitoring**: Track token usage and API costs in real-time
- **Context management**: Clear clutter without losing session state
- **Tool integration**: Connect browsers, databases, and custom tools
- **Workflow efficiency**: Execute common actions with single commands
- **Session visibility**: Understand what's in your context

## Challenge Tasks

Complete these tasks using only slash commands:

1. Check your current token usage
2. View detailed session statistics
3. List all files currently in context
4. Clear the conversation while keeping file context
5. Connect to an MCP server (if configured)
6. Take a screenshot of a website using Chrome integration
7. Switch to a different model and switch back

## Bonus Challenge

Create a workflow using slash commands:
1. Start session in a project
2. Load files you need
3. Check token budget with `/usage`
4. Work on your task
5. Monitor with `/stats` periodically
6. Use `/clear` when context gets cluttered
7. Verify final state with `/files` and `/usage`
