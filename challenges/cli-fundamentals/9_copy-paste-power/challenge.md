# Copy-Paste Power User Techniques

**Related Tip:** Tip 10: Use Cmd+A/Ctrl+A for web content

## Description

Efficiently feeding content to Claude Code requires mastering advanced copy-paste techniques. Whether you're sharing documentation from the web, code from GitHub, or content from PDFs, knowing how to extract and transfer information quickly is essential for productive AI collaboration.

## Objective

Master advanced copy-paste workflows for efficiently transferring content from various sources into Claude Code conversations. Learn keyboard shortcuts, selection techniques, and content preparation strategies.

## Why Copy-Paste Mastery Matters

### Speed
- Keyboard shortcuts are 10x faster than mouse operations
- Select all (Ctrl+A/Cmd+A) is faster than manual selection
- Proper selection avoids re-work

### Accuracy
- Precise selection = accurate context
- Avoiding UI chrome = cleaner input
- Proper formatting preservation

### Sources
- Web documentation
- GitHub repositories
- Stack Overflow answers
- PDF documents
- Error messages
- Log files

## Essential Techniques

### 1. Select All for Web Content
```
Cmd+A (macOS) / Ctrl+A (Windows/Linux)
```
Fastest way to grab documentation pages

### 2. Reader Mode Selection
Use browser reader mode to remove UI clutter before copying

### 3. Code Block Extraction
GitHub and docs sites have "copy" buttons on code blocks

### 4. PDF Text Selection
Copy from PDFs while preserving formatting

### 5. Multi-Source Compilation
Gather content from multiple tabs/windows

### 6. Screenshot + OCR
When copy isn't possible, screenshot and let Claude read it

## Steps to Complete

1. Practice selecting full web pages with Cmd+A/Ctrl+A
2. Use reader mode to clean content before copying
3. Extract code blocks from GitHub
4. Copy formatted content from documentation
5. Handle multi-page content efficiently
6. Master keyboard-only workflows

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can extract web content without mouse
- [ ] Can clean content before copying
- [ ] Can extract code blocks precisely
- [ ] Can handle multi-source content
- [ ] Know when to use screenshots vs copy
- [ ] Can preserve formatting when needed
- [ ] Understand content preparation best practices

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Documentation Extraction
Find a technical documentation page, extract the relevant section cleanly

### Task 2: GitHub Code
Copy a complete file from GitHub with proper formatting

### Task 3: Stack Overflow Solution
Extract a question and answer, removing UI clutter

### Task 4: Multi-Source Research
Gather content from 3 different sources and compile

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Learning New API
```
1. Find API documentation
2. Enable reader mode (if available)
3. Cmd+A to select all
4. Cmd+C to copy
5. Paste in Claude: "Explain this API documentation"
```

### Scenario 2: Debugging with Stack Overflow
```
1. Find relevant SO answer
2. Copy question context
3. Copy answer code
4. Paste in Claude: "Explain this solution and how to apply it"
```

### Scenario 3: Code Review from GitHub
```
1. Navigate to file on GitHub
2. Click "Raw" button
3. Cmd+A to select all
4. Paste in Claude: "Review this code for security issues"
```

### Scenario 4: Error Investigation
```
1. Error appears in terminal/browser
2. Select full stack trace
3. Copy to clipboard
4. Paste in Claude: "Debug this error"
```

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Manual Selection
Slowly dragging mouse to select text

### ❌ Copying UI Chrome
Including website headers, sidebars, ads

### ❌ Partial Content
Missing critical context by selecting too little

### ❌ No Cleaning
Pasting raw HTML or messy formatting

### ✓ Efficient Workflow
Keyboard shortcuts + reader mode + clean selection
