# Problem Decomposition Mastery

**Related Tip:** Tip 3: Break large problems into smaller ones

## Description

Large problems overwhelm both humans and AI. The key to success with Claude Code is breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces that can be solved sequentially. This challenge teaches you to decompose problems effectively, leading to better results and fewer context issues.

## Objective

Master the art of problem decomposition to tackle complex projects efficiently. Learn to identify natural breaking points, create actionable subtasks, and execute them in optimal order.

## Why Decomposition Matters

### For Claude:
- **Context efficiency**: Smaller problems fit better in context window
- **Higher accuracy**: Focused tasks get better solutions
- **Easier debugging**: Isolate and fix specific issues
- **Better reasoning**: More depth on each subtask

### For You:
- **Clear progress**: Track completion of each piece
- **Reduced overwhelm**: Bite-sized tasks are manageable
- **Better planning**: See dependencies and blockers
- **Easier review**: Verify each piece before moving on

## Problem Decomposition Framework

### 1. Identify the Goal
What's the end state you want to achieve?

### 2. List Major Components
What are the 3-5 major pieces?

### 3. Break Down Each Component
What are the specific tasks within each piece?

### 4. Identify Dependencies
What must be done before what?

### 5. Sequence Tasks
Order tasks by dependencies and logical flow

### 6. Size Check
Each task should be completable in one focused session (< 30 min)

## Steps to Complete

1. Take a complex problem (provided below)
2. Decompose it using the framework
3. Create a TodoWrite list with all subtasks
4. Execute each task sequentially with Claude Code
5. Track progress and adjust as needed
6. Reflect on what worked and what didn't

## Practice Problem

**Complex Task**: Build a blog system with user authentication

This involves:
- User registration and login
- Blog post creation, editing, deletion
- Comment system
- User profiles
- Admin dashboard
- Email notifications
- Image uploads
- Search functionality

**Your Challenge**: Break this down into 10-15 manageable tasks

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can identify major components of a complex problem
- [ ] Can break components into specific, actionable tasks
- [ ] Each task is appropriately sized (completable in < 30 min)
- [ ] Tasks are sequenced with dependencies in mind
- [ ] Can explain why tasks are ordered as they are
- [ ] Can execute tasks sequentially without context overflow

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Too Large
"Implement the entire blog system"
- Problem: Overwhelming, unclear where to start

### ❌ Too Small
"Add a semicolon to line 42"
- Problem: Too granular, creates task management overhead

### ❌ No Dependencies
"Do all tasks in any order"
- Problem: Will hit blockers when later tasks need earlier foundations

### ❌ No Verification
"Complete all tasks then test"
- Problem: Bugs compound, hard to isolate issues

### ✓ Just Right
"Create database schema for users table with email, password, and timestamps"
- Right size: 15-30 minutes
- Clear goal: Specific deliverable
- Testable: Can verify schema is correct

## Challenge Tasks

1. **Decompose the blog system** (see Practice Problem)
2. **Create a TodoWrite list** with your breakdown
3. **Execute first 3 tasks** with Claude Code
4. **Reflect**: What adjustments did you need to make?
5. **Try another problem**: Pick a real project and decompose it

## Bonus Challenge

Take a problem you struggled with before. Decompose it using this framework and try again. Compare:
- Time to completion
- Quality of solution
- Number of issues encountered
- Your stress level throughout
